# Canvas-Redesign-HCI

Authors: Luke Selby, Cale Stringfellow, Joseph Rodriguez

This is a redesign of the UI of Canvas learning management software.

The existing UI of Canvas has several issues that need to
be addressed:

Overly Complicated: There are many features that are
not often used by students and only make the website
more confusing to navigate. For example, all three mem-
bers of the team are in their senior year and have never
had to click on ”BigBlueButton”, ”Collaborations”, or
”NewAnalytics”. They only serve to increase the amount
of buttons to sort through.

Lack of Critical Information: Students will likely want
to see their important due dates and grades from the
dashboard in card mode, allowing them to see their
progress easily at a glance. However, the dashboard of the
website only shows class cards, an unsorted upcoming as-
signments list, recent graded assignments, a view grades
button, and a start new course button, the latter two being
in the bottom right corner where most computer screens
have to scroll down to. Most important items, such as
grades or class-specific upcoming assignments, must be
found through clicking through multiple pages.

Inconsistencies between List and Card view: Card view
does not have a notification center while list view does.

No Dark Mode: Canvas lacks a dark mode. Including it
can improve accessibility for users who suffer from eye
strain or light sensitivity.
